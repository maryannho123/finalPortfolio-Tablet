                            This past summer I worked in Portland, OR at Collins Aerospace.
                            I evaluated performance characteristics of proprietary and competitor airborne radars for use in autonomous airway landing in low visibility conditions
                            I also diagnosed and resolved electrical issues that interfered with the performance of radars during live test in the air. 
                            The main accomplishment is that I implemented radar data collection and processing in MatLab to extract detected objects from airborne radars in various testing environments

                            As an R&D Intern, I analyzed ten years worth of sodium lidar measurements through MatLab to characterize sodium photon counts, wind, and temperature in the atmosphere.
                            I also developed LabVIEW tutorials and technical reports for data acquisition systems in order to update and optimize the two Lidar systems. 
                            I conducted alignment procedures for Coherent 899-21 Ring Dye Laser and various optic measurements using fiber cables to train graduate students.

                        I completed understanding of in-house software tools for data analysis in order to identify imaging
                        biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis for women. I utilized Python and Linux environment in order to prepare post-chemotherapy MRI scans to train a deep
                        dual channel neural network using a Python library, TensorFlow, to identify characteristics in subtypes of
                        breast cancer for noninvasive and personalized treatment.
